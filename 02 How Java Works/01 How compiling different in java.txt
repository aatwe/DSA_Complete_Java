1) Where is code stored in java?
	.java file


2) Code is given to Compiler 
	What compiler does? takes file and converts to machine readable format
	Does it compile into machine code? No not directly

	2.a) Java Compiler(javac) Convert (.java file) into Byte code (.class file)
		What compier does? Converts ENTIRE FILE
		How to run byte code? Java Virtual Machine(JVM)

	2.b) Java Interpreter Convert byte code(.class file) into machine code () (0s , 1s)
		What interpreter does? converts LINE BY LINE		//quick fact: python can execute line by line -> 								interpreted langugage
		How to run machine code?

Q1) How C / C++ compiling different? Directly converts into executable machine code
									//LOL : also java does not have pointers

Q2) What is java feature in compiling?
			-> Java is platform indpeendent (Can share .class file to run on any OS)
Q3) What is platform independence?

Byte code (.java -> .class )can run on all OS  
    executable file compiled on Macbook wont run on windows. Have to compile again on Windows
	.exe : -> Has instructions depending on platform : depends on Architecture of computer(CPU, registers)
                 .class -> can run on any ---> .exe run on any system
			   via JVM

	3.1) Can JVM run on any OS? no, different for different (Platofrm dependent)
		Windows JVM , Mac JVM
	but .class file still same
