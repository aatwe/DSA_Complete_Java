NOte: Linked List and trees are most important

1) What are linkedlist

java arrays are not contagious
cannot add items in array once full


Solution: ArrayList : Amortized -> doubles and copies  O(1)

//still limiting


2) Linkedlist breaks into boxes / nodes  //where nodes? at different places


3) What is node
	its own type
   contains:
		value , which node pointing to 
		val	   Node next;

------------------------------------------
//Definition of a node

	class Node {
		int val;
		Node next;
	}
------------------------------------------

2) How are they connected?

head					  tail
node A -> node B -> node C -> node D

What is head? reference variable in stack pointing to first node

What is tail? reference variable in stack pointing to last node
			note: tail node points to null

Each node only knows its value and what pointing to


LinkedList questions: 
	a) with head
	b) with head and tail //easier
