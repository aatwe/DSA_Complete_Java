1) What to save file as? main.java in a folder
	Q) What is this .java file? A Class itself	//named group of property and functions
				What is the name of class? filename : mainn 
	Q) How to identify a class? First letter capital 
for ex
Main.java
public class Main {		//What is public? restricts sharing code to other files  // makes available out side calss
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
}
-> try compiling -> Output .java file  //bytecode cv 


2) What is inside? a main functionj where program //where program starts
		What if no main function? cant run the program


3) //Where is the main function in java?
public class Main {
  public static void main (String[] args) {

}
}




4) Create a byte code from java file. How? Compile the code using javac
1) cd to your directory
2) javac main.java
3) What output generated? main.class  --> Byte code

public class Main {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
   System.out.println("Hello World");
}
}


5) What byte code looks like? Open in text editor
//Cant understand


6) What if we share main.class file with anyone ---> anyone can run //platform independent
__________________________________________________
 public static void main (String[] args) {
___________________________________________________


Q1) what is public? access modifier ,  for sharing with anyone

Q2) What is static? NOT DEPENDENT ON OBJECT
  	Some variables and methods are object dependent	for ex name variable of a Class Human , depends on object of Class Human		//manoj, dinesh etc
	some variables do not depend on any object	for ex population variable of class HUman , does not depend on any object		//7 Million constant (for now)

Q3) What is main? a function 
	  When is main run? first thing
		How to run it first? without creating object
				How to make it run without creating object? declare static
				How to run 
			

Q4) What is void?Return type
				What is return type? what value function is returning	
			 		what the function is returning for void return type --> No value 

Q5) What is args? array of command line args
	What is in args? command line arguments we give in terminal
			//What are command line arguments? What are commands? executable files located in computer 
				Where are commands stored? Command : where javac 
					/usr/bin/javac
					//when enter command --> same as opening the javac file					
				How computer finds these commands ? Path variables + Environment variables
					for ex echo $PATH --> it will check in given locations, checks command availalbe in List of folders in environment variable
				//can check: cat .zprofile
Use of args:
check	below

//Demo.java	
public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(args[0]);
}
//
> javac Demo.java
> java Demo 30	//30 passed as command line argument
Output: 30

or

> javac Demo.java
> java Demo 30 Kunal	//30 passed as command line argument
Output: Kunal

	//Q) How computer finds command javac from location?
		

Q) How to change location of byte code (.class) file? Do while compiling
javac-d . Demo.java	//Stores .class in Current directory
javac-d .. Demo.java	//Stores .class in Previous directory

Q) What is the best practice?
source code -> src folder
Byte code   -> out folder
