When type conversion occurs?
	1 type of data ---> assigned to other type of variable	


How type conversion occurs? 
	1) Automatically (Implicitly)
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		float num = input.nextFloat();
		System.out.println(num);

		>67			//input : int
		-> 67.0		//auto convert int -> float
		

	2) Explicitly	//When implicit not allowed
		int num = (int)(67.56f);	//narrow down float to int	to type < from type
		System.out.println(num);



What conditions for implicit typecasting?
	1) 2 types should be compatible
		Numeric to numeric  allowed
		numeric to non numeric not allowed
			however? char a =(char)num1	//can do explicitly


	2) to type > from type	ex float > int	
		for ex int num = input.nextFloat();	//doesnt work


Philosophy: Asking for small and getting bigger doesnt work, as for bigger and get small

Case1: 
	What if range of to type < from type no. ? 	Remainder of exceeding value
	for ex a > range of b  //byte range = 256
	int a = 257;
	byte b = (byte)(a);
	System.out.println(b);
	> 1					// 257%256

	

Case2:
	byte a = 40;
	byte b = 50;
	byte c = 100;
	int d = a*b/c;			//Why int? a*b/c got auto promoted from byte to int	
	System.out.println(d);

	//How 50*40 = 2000 is stored in byte data type , mid calculation? 
	AUTO PROMOTION
	//Byte promoted to Int during mid calculation


	for ex blow //Error
	byte b = 50;
	b = b*100		//exceeds + auto promoted to int  , cant store in byte ,  should be int instead


Q) What auto promotions are allowed?
byte/char/short 			---> int
int/byte/char/short 		---> long
int/byte/char/short 		---> float
int/byte/char/short/float	---> double



Case 3:
	How to type cast int/float to boolean? Use Boolean class method parseBoolean
	String s1 = "true";
	boolean b1 =Boolean.parseBoolean(s1);
	System.out.println(b1);

	>Output: true



Case 4:
	What if System.out.println("नमस्ते") ?
	>Output: नमस्ते
	//How didi it get printed in terminal? Unicode
	//Implies:  java supports unicode, can print different character in different languages

Case 5:
	int number = 'A';
	int number2 = 'a';
	System.out.println(number);
	System.out.println(number2);

	Output:  
		    
	>65
	>97
	//How auto implicit conversion from char to int (	ASCII)



Case 6:
	What if there are multiple types?
	ALL GET cONVERTED TO BIGGER ONES
