Its called type checking
What is type checking? Computer will compile and interpret program into  machine level code

Converting  from program lang --> machine level code = compilation

When is type checking done

for ex a =10

1) compile time	//static language

int a = 10		
int a = "Kunal"	//gives error	//before running, during conversion program should know what is type of a
	

//runtime errors are less


2) runtime	//runtime
Type checking at runtime
dont have to specify type previously

ex 
a = 10		//no error
a = "Kunal"	//no error		//points to correct place before compilation


//saves time
//runtime error prone
