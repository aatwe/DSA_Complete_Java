What is programing langugage?
Instruction to a computer in human readable format
//internally translated to 0s and 1s






What types of languages?


1) Procedural:
	well structured steps and procedures(order of statements+function+command)

	for ex -> order important below
	1) input first no.
	2) input second no.
	3) calculate sum of both
	//many ways to take care of order: loops,statements,cases, functions etc

	for ex java,c++, python : all follow procedural lang



2) Functional
	write program in pure functions
	what is function? reusable bundle of code	

Use case: lots of same operations on different set of data		//does not modify the original dataset -> creates new one as output
 
ex Dataset for machine learning , used to create algo,models etc

ex first class functions:
	assigning functions to variables etc  ex python
		python has first class functions


Q) Does python follow functional and procedural?


3) Object orient programming
	object = code + data

	What if different data types mixed in a collection? -> Custom data type
	How to create custom data types? classes
		What are classes? properties + functions named groups
			What is instance of this class? object
			int a = 10	//10 is object instance running in memory


Objective of oop: divide code into chunks to make it ez to develop, debug and reuse & maintain software

All are mixed
