1) What is stack?
	Where we saw stack? Recursion:
	
	function calls go in stack
			what order of going in stack?	//Input
	| fun() |	5
	| fun() |	4
	| fun() |	3
	| fun() |	2
	| fun() |	1
	|_______|

		When function call is entered -> gets pushed/ added to stack



2) What output was removed first from stack?


	| fun() |	1
	| fun() |	2
	| fun() |	3
	| fun() |	4
	| fun() |	5
	|_______|


		Whena  fucntion call is finished -> gets popped/remove from stack




Conclusion: Item that comes first, is removed last	FILO
		 Item that comes last , is remove first	LIFO


What we know about? arrays/linkedlists/arraylists etc

What we dont know? Queue
	We will learn to 
		create our own Queue
		use Queue provided by java



2) 1) What is Queue?
	Where we say stack? Recursion:
	
			Insertion from back
			what order of going in Queue?	//Input
	|  p5   |	1		//p5 went in first , came out first
	|  p4   |	2
	|  p3   |	3
	|  p2   |	4
	|  p1   |	5
	|       |

		



2) What output was removed first from Queue?
			
			Removal from front
	|  p1   |			//p1 input last -> output : last
	|       |	
	|       |	
	|       |	
	|       |	
	|       |







Conclusion: Item that comes first, is removed first	FIFO
		 Item that comes last , is remove last		LILO


What we know about? arrays/linkedlists/arraylists etc

What we dont know? Queue
	We will learn to 
		create our own Queue/Circular Queue / Dynamic Queue
		use Queue provided by java
