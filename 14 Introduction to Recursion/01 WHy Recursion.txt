can solve big complex problem in simpler way

DP/Star of hanoi etc


Can we convert recursion to without function calls with loops (iteration) ? YES


1) solve using recursion
2) solve using iteration for optimization (difficult)



Q) Recursion time complexity analysis:


Q) Recursion space complexity analysis:

Recursion:
	Growing : O(n)
	//printing n no. 


Iterative:
	Constant: O(1)


Q) How to visualize recursion? Recursion tree

Recursion tree

  print(1) -> print(2) -> print(3) -> print(4) -> print(5) -> return
>1	      >2		  >3		   >4	 	    >5



Q) how to check if recursion is applicable? If smaller version of problem solvable -> can apply recursion
1) Try breaking into smaller problems  //find recurrence relation
