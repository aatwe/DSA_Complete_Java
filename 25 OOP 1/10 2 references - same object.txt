Objective: Create object with ref var1, point ref var2 to same object, 
change value of object instance variable, check if reference var2 shows change


//changes made using one -> reflect in two

class Student {
    int rno;
    String name;
    float marks;
  
    Student (int rno, String name, float marks) {
        this.rno = rno; 			//becomes random.rno = abhi.rno
        this.name = name;
        this.marks = marks; 			//can do marks = other.marks but prior is better convention
    }

    Student() {			//Function //return type = class, no name
        this(13, "default person", 100.0f);
    }

}
class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Student one = new Student();
	 Student two = one;
	 one.name = "Something Something";
	 System.out.println(two.name);
    }
}
>Something Something


Conclusion var1 and var2 point to same object, change in 1 will reflect
