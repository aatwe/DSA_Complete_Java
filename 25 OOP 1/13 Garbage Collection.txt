a) Garbage collector releases memory for unrachable objects

//Automatically 

b) How to destroy object manually in java? Cannot

c) Feature in java: Finalizer
How to perform actions when object destroyed? finalize class


ex. when object destroyed , display message
    when file object destroyed, close stream
	etc	


		
class A {
    final int num = 10;
    String name;

    public A(String name) {
        System.out.println("Object is created");
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Object is destroyed");
    }

}


class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final A kunal = new A("Kunal Kushwaha");
        kunal.name = "other name";                        ////can change object values
        A obj;	
	
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {			//note have to be many objects -> if less load on memory -> objects are not destroyed
            obj = new A("Random name");            //what created? one object , other objects will be uninit, why? same ref var can only point to 1 object --> who removes garbage collector
        }
    }
}



//if any object of class A freed -> finalize() called


Q) Can we do obj.finalize() ? NO  , Exception

Q) What is override? later

Q) What is throwable? later
