Q1) What is scope? region where we can access our variables
for ex below scope of a is main()
			 not in random() -> cannot access and use a in random()

public class Scope {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		int b = 20;
}

	static void random() {
		System.out.println(a);

}

}


1) What is function scope? Variables inside a function can be accesssed inside a function


2) What if we insert simple {} block scope inside variable. 
	variables init in that --> accessible in that only


3) Can we change value initialized outside, inside a block? yes

4) initialized outside --> can use inside block, cannot be initialized inside block
   initialized inside  --> cannot be used outside block , can be initialized again outside block
