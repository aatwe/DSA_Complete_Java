1) Time complexity is NOT =  time taken to run algo
	if time taken by computer A > computer B
	does not mean TC (A) >  TC (B)

2) For TC plot time taken vs size


3) We if time vs size for A = linear
	time vs size for B = linear //less slop

TC (A) = TC(B) = O(n)

4) What is TC? function time vs size

Analyse Linear search vs Binary search


1) Linear Search
Time vs Size : O(n)
Why Linear search TC is O(n) -> worst case last element of array


2) Binary Search
Time vs Size : O(Log(n))
