Objective:	 How to initialize static variables? static block
			when staic block executed? once, when class loaded

Ex
package com.kunal.staticExample;

public class StaticBlock {
	static int a = 4;
	static int b;

	static{
		//initialize here
		System.out.println("I am in static block");
		b = a*5;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		StaticBlock obj = new StaticBlock();
		System.out.println(StaticBlock.a + " " + StaticBlock.b);
	}

} 
>I am in static block
4  20


Objective: What if we change the value of b and then create another object

Ex

public class StaticBlock {
	static int a = 4;
	static int b;

	static{
		//initialize here
		System.out.println("I am in static block");
		b = a*5;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		StaticBlock obj = new StaticBlock();
		System.out.println(StaticBlock.a + " " + StaticBlock.b);		//4 20

		StaticBlock.b += 3;
		System.out.println(StaticBlock.a + " " + StaticBlock.b);		//4 23


		StaticBlock obj2 = new StaticBlock();
		System.out.println(StaticBlock.a + " " + StaticBlock.b);		//4 23
	}

} 

Conclusion?
if create a new object obj2 -> static{} block didnt run again

Static block ran when? only once when first object obj1 was created
		//first object created = class is loaded
		//if it had run -> would have seen 4,20 not 4,23


Note:
a) static elements are loaded first in class
